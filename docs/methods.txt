Controller Class Methods:
-------------------

1. Annotations
   - View:       Set view to render at the end of method execution.
                 If not defined, use same method name for view.
   - Layout:     Define layout to use in order to show the content on web page.
                 If not defined, use Class layout.
   - Api:        With no value.
                 Set this method as API method (doesn't render view, only returns
                 values).
                 The method with this annotation must have return value.
   - ReturnType: Use with api.
                 Set the return type of current method.
                 Values: XML, JSON, RAW, FILE.
   - MimeType:   If ReturnType equals "RAW" or "FILE", this value determines the
                 Mime-Type to return.
