MVC how-to:
-----------

J3 MVC implementation is similar to others frameworks.

The main idea consists in use URL <protocol>://<host>/<controller>/<method>/<other_params>

All user files must be located under "mvc" folder.

Every controller class must extends J3BaseController.

J3BaseController is under mvc/controllers directory. This class allows modifications in order to create
variables and functions for all other controllers.

Every public method in controller become a view. Please, see Annotations reference to details.

Under views folder must exists one folder for every controller (not API).

Every view can implements one layout.

In layouts/view exists three objects:
- $c - Controller object.
- $v - View object. Allow use render methods.
- $m - Method Object. Allow access to method local defined variables.
