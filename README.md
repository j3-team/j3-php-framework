# j3-php-framework

j3 is a PHP framework intended to make the building of webapps quicker and easier.

The idea is to serve as help to PHP developers, providing tools and an estructure to make the work simplier and effcient. These tools will provide help to use MVC models, databases and web services, also it will  provide a set of modules that allow to customize each application and to optimize them.

Project is under development, alpha version is not ready.

# Installation

For now there is no installer, to make j3 to work, you need to download the source code and put it in your htmldocs folder (/var/www is the most common folder in Linux).
